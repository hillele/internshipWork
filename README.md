## CARA Pro Bono Interactive Map Page
  by: Elex Hill

This is a hopefully easy to follow guide/tutorial of how to create/update a diaspora map for the CARA Pro Bono Project and then get that map onto a webpage. 

Feel free to clone this repo for your personal github or anything like that. 

Guide starts on DataPrep.md (need move that into here)
