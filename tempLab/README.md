### Lab 3 Repo

This repo contains all of the necessary files turned in for Lab 3 by Elex Hill

This is the link to my map: http://students.washington.edu/hillele/parkPage.html

Scraper.ipynb in this repo is my commented code for creating this map and olympiaParks are the files for the shapefile. 

This project focuses on the parks maintained by the City of Olympia and what ammenities they offer at each place. Data was pulled mainly from the City of Olympia's page (the exact URL can be found in my code) and a basemap from Stamen. Looking at the map, you can see that the ammenities are fairly evenly spread, not many are dead zones. 

This is an important thing to examine because parks provide an area of preserved or provided nature that is necessary to helping humans feel like they have a place to escape and relax and the more ammenities a park has the nicer it tends to be, and I wanted to see if the City of Olympia was ignoring any specific areas. 

As far as difficulties, most of the challenges I faced was catching up on coding information that I had missed in class while I was sick. In particular, I had no idea how to effectively scrape a website for the longest time. Eventually it all clicked while I was looking through the class provided slides. But because I was playing catchup for most of this assignment I was unable to create a more indepth, interesting map. 

This project has taken me the most amount of time to work on simply because I had so much trouble finding the information I needed to understand the code I was producing. All in all, I spent about 15 hours on this project. There was a lot of trial and error in the scraper section, and then the geocoding took almost as long when I found out the API I was using wasn't able to find my addresses and geocode them for me. And then I kind of rushed through the actual map making process while frantically trying to make it visually appealing.
